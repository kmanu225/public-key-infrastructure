# pki-web-app-demo

This repository contains resources for a web application I created to demonstrate the usage of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for setting up HTTPS communication.

The tutorial explaining the deployment and concepts is available on my personal website: [Demo PKI Deployment Tutorial](https://kmanu225.gitbook.io/cs/cybersecurity/secrets-management/demo-pki-deployment)
